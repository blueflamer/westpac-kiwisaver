Feature: Provide User with correct information related to Calculator fields

As a Product Owner I want that while using the KiwiSaver Retirement Calculator all fields in the calculator have got the information icon present So that The user is able to get a clear understanding of what needs to be entered in the field.

Scenario: When the User Clicks on information icon besides Current age the message related to Current age is displayed. 
    Given I navigate to Westpac Home Page 
    And I select "KiwiSaver Calculators" from "KiwiSaver" main menu
    Then the "KiwiSaver Calculators" page loads
    And I click on "Click here to get started."
    Then the "KiwiSaver Retirement Calculator" page loads
    And I click on information icon besides "Current age" field
    #Then a message: "This calculator has an age limit of 64 years old as you need to be under the age of 65 to join KiwiSaver." is displayed below the "Current age" field
    Then a message: "This calculator has an age limit of 18 to 64 years old." is displayed below the "Current age" field
